# Login and Signup screen

This is a simple Login and Signup window layout coded in Python that works on desktop and shows a bit of my current programming skills, mainly when it comes to the PySide6 library.
In the application, the user can choose which type of account he is going to sign up for or log in to (Company, employer, or employee). All the features are totally graphic, representing only the front end of this in-progress project.
